        <h3><i class="fa fa-phone" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; Answer calls immediately and in a warm and friendly manner.</h3>
<p>This is the first and most crucial step in creating a positive experience for customers. When customers call, it's important to answer the phone promptly and greet them warmly. Make them feel welcome and appreciated right from the start.</p>

<p>Here are some sample scripts:</p>
<ol class="other-list">
  <li>Thank you for calling [company name], my name is [your name]. How may I assist you today?
</li>
  <li>Good morning/afternoon/evening, thank you for calling Legend Air. This is [your name] speaking. How can I help you?</li>

<i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; 
Pay attention to details and complete tasks before moving on to the
          next call.
        </h3>
        <p>Ensure that customer requests are handled efficiently and effectively by paying close attention to detail and completing tasks before moving on to the next call. Failing to document all the necessary details can be costly as it may result in the loss of business or missed appointments. It is crucial for the customer service representative to be present to ensure accuracy and thoroughness in their work to avoid potential mistakes and ensure customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
  <em><li>Listen actively. This will help you gather all the necessary information to provide effective solutions.</li>
  <li>Take notes. Write down important details during the call, including the customer's name, contact information, and the details of their issue. This will help you remember important information and prevent mistakes.</li>
  <li>Double-check. Before moving on to the next call, take a moment to double-check that you have completed all necessary tasks and have not missed any important details.</li>

          Repeat things back to the customer and make sure they fully understand
          what is going on.</h3>
     <p>Repeat key information back to the customer to make sure that you've understood their issue correctly. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications. It's also important to make sure that the customer understands the solution you're proposing and the next steps.</p>
<p>Here are some sample scripts for paraphrasing:</p>
<em><ul>
  <li>Just to confirm, you're requesting a service call for your [issue] on [appointment], is that correct?
</li>
<li>I want to make sure that I have everything correct. You said that [repeat issue], and you need [repeat request]. Is that accurate?</li>
</ul></em>

        <h3>
          <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>&nbsp; Be assertive and take control of the conversation.
        </h3>
<p>As the customer service representative, you should be in control of the call. Direct the conversation and steer it back if it goes out of control. It's important to keep the conversation on track and avoid getting sidetracked. If the customer starts to veer off-topic, steer the conversation back to the issue at hand. Be polite but firm in your approach. It also helps to ask close-ended questions. 
</p>

<p>Here are some sample scripts:</p>
<em><ul><li>
I understand your frustration. In order to resolve this issue, could you provide me with some specific details. You're saying that X happened, and you'd like Y as a resolution. Is that correct?</li>
<li>
I understand you had a less than satisfactory experience with X. We can discuss that further once we have resolved the current issue. I want to make sure we're addressing your issue with Y in the most effective way possible. When would be the best time to have a technician over to have a look at Y?</li></ul></em>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-user-plus" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          Help customers join the membership on the call.
        </h3>
<p>        If the customer is interested in joining the membership, make sure to provide them with all the necessary information and assistance they need. This will help them feel valued and appreciated, and it can also lead to future business opportunities.</p>

<p>Here are some sample scripts:</p>
<em><ul>
  <li>Are you interested in learning more about our membership program? It comes with a lot of benefits and discounts on our products and services. I can help you sign up today if you have a few minutes.</li>
  <li>Joining our membership program is a great way to get more value out of our products and services. Let me walk you through the process and get you signed up today.</li>
  <li>As a member, you'll receive exclusive offers and discounts that non-members don't have access to. Let me know if you'd like to join and I'll be happy to help you get started.</li>
</ul></em>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-calendar-check-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          Book the call.
        </h3>
<p>Booking the call is crucial for our business. If we don't schedule the appointment, we risk losing the customer and their business. Let's make sure to prioritize booking the call in every interaction. Every call we receive is an opportunity to serve our customers and grow our business. To make sure we don't miss out on these opportunities, let's aim to book every call we receive.</p>
<p>Here are some tips on how to book a call:</p>
<em>
  <ul>
    <li>Gather all the necessary information. Ask for all the necessary details, such as the customer’s name, contact number, and address. This will ensure that the call is properly scheduled and that the technician is dispatched to the right location.


</li>

        <h3><i class="fa fa-star-half-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
          Address customer complaints.
        </h3>
      <p>While the customer may not always be right, the customer deserves the right to be heard. It's important to listen actively to the customer's grievances and show empathy towards their situation, rather than immediately dismissing their complaints. By actively listening to the customer, you can better understand their perspective and find a solution that meets their needs. This can also help to de-escalate the situation and prevent the customer from becoming even more upset. Additionally, acknowledging the customer's concerns and showing a willingness to work with them to find a solution can help to build trust and loyalty. </p>
      <p>Here are some tips for addressing customer complaints:</p>
      <em><ul>
        <li>Listen actively. Show that you are paying attention and understand their perspective by using active listening techniques such as verbal nodding, paraphrasing, and summarizing.



</li>
        <li>Acknowledge their feelings. Express empathy and understanding for the customer's situation and apologize for any inconvenience caused.</li>
        <li>Take ownership. Take responsibility for the issue and assure the customer that you will check all possible options to resolve the issue.</li>
        <li>Offer a solution. Based on the customer's complaint, offer a solution that will resolve the issue to their satisfaction. Suggest other options if the initial solution is not agreeable. </li>
        <li>If unable to provide an answer or solution, it is crucial to notify the manager and get the answer immediately. This shows the customer that their concerns are being taken seriously and that the company is committed to finding a solution. Providing prompt and effective solutions to customer problems is a critical part of providing excellent customer service.</li>

      </ul></em>

         Never provide incorrect information to customers, if unsure, offer to find out the correct information.
        </h3>
<p>When unsure of an answer, it is essential to find out the correct information instead of providing wrong information. Providing false or inaccurate information can be damaging to the customer's experience and can result in frustration or dissatisfaction. It is better to admit to not knowing the answer and offer to find out the correct information than to provide wrong information.</p>
<p>Some sample scripts that you can use are:
</p>
<em><ul>
  <li>Thank you for bringing that to my attention. I don’t have an answer at the moment, but I will speak to my manager and get back to you as soon as possible with the correct information.
</li>

  <li>I want to make sure that I provide you with the correct information. May I call you back after I speak with my supervisor to get more details?
