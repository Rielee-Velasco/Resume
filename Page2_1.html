      <h3>Deleted Email Recovery</h3>
      <p>
        By default, any email deleted from your mailbox goes through the
        following process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>The email is moved to your Deleted Items folder.</li>
        <li>
          If you purge or remove items from your Deleted Items folder, they are
          moved to the Dumpster where they are still recoverable.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Dumpster only holds email messages for 14 days once they've been
          removed from Deleted Items.
        </li>
        <li>
          Deleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or the
          Dumpster. Once it has been permanently deleted from the dumpster, it
          cannot be recovered.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>How to Recover Deleted Items from the Dumpster:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to the Deleted Items folder.</li>
        <li>Under the Home tab, choose Recover Deleted Items from Server.</li>
        <li>
          Choose the email that needs to be recovered (you can choose more than
          one).
        </li>
        <li>Choose Restore Selected Items and click OK.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note: Deleted email can be recovered from the Deleted Items folder or
        the Dumpster. Once it has been permanently deleted from the dumpster, it
        cannot be recovered. Also, Deleted Email Recovery is only available in
        OWA or Outlook.
