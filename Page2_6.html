      <h3>Lead Confirmation Procedure</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Greet the customer.</h4>
          <p>
            The first step in the lead confirmation procedure is to greet the
            customer warmly and professionally. This sets the tone for the rest
            of the interaction and establishes a positive relationship with the
            customer. A friendly greeting can help put the customer at ease and
            make them more receptive to the rest of the conversation. It's
            important to greet the customer by their name, and to introduce
            yourself and our company. This helps establish a personal connection
            and makes the interaction more personable.

          <p>Here are some examples of scripts to start the call:</p>
          <em>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Hey there, this is Brad calling from ABC Company. How are you
                doing today?
              </li>
              <li>
                This is Brad with ABC Company. Thanks for taking my call. How
                are you doing?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </em>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Confirm the date, time, and address of the appointment.</h4>
          <p>
            Confirming the date, time, and address of the appointment is an
            essential step in ensuring that we are on the same page as the
            customer. It shows that we value the customer's time and that we are
            organized and efficient in delivering our service. When confirming
            the appointment details, it's important to double-check the date,
            time, and address to avoid any confusion or miscommunication. This
            also gives the customer the opportunity to make any necessary
            changes or adjustments if there are conflicts in their schedule or
            if there are any unforeseen circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some examples of scripts to confirm the details of the
            appointment:
          </p>
          <em
            ><ul>
              <li>
                So we're just making sure that you and your spouse are available
                for us on [date] [time] at[location/address] . That's a good
                time for you guys, right?
              </li>
              <li>
                I'm calling to double-check our appointment details. We're all
                set for [date] at [time] at [location/address]. That schedule
                works for you and your spouse, yes?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </em>
        </li>
        <p>
          It’s important to phrase this question in a way that includes the
          spouse’s availability in preparation for the next question.
        </p>
        <li>
          <h4>
            Confirm that all decision makers will be present at the time of the
            visit.
          </h4>
          <p>
            By confirming the presence of all decision-makers, we avoid any
            last-minute changes or delays that may arise due to the absence of a
            decision-maker. This helps to ensure a smooth and successful lead
            appointment, reducing the likelihood of any potential complications
            or obstacles that may arise during the sales process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some examples of scripts to confirm the availability of
            decision makers:
          </p>
          <em><ul>
            <li>
              Just to confirm, will all decision makers be present for the
              appointment on [date] at [time]?
            </li>
            <li>
              I just want to make sure that we'll be able to speak to everyone
              who needs to be involved. Are all decision makers available for
              the appointment on [date] at [time]?
            </li>
            <li>
              Just so we can avoid any delays in the process, will [date] at
              [time] work for all the decision makers?
            </li></em>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>
            Confirm that there will be enough time for the service to be done.
          </h4>
          <p>
            It's crucial to confirm that there will be enough time for the
            service to be done and it's important to ensure that the customer's
            expectations are managed and that the service can be completed
            efficiently.
          </p>
         
          <em
            ><ul>
              <li>
                Just to double-check, we're not getting in the way of any prior
                engagements, right? Like any special plans or events such as
                skydiving, brunch, or dinner?
              </li>
            </ul></em
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>
            Confirm the service that the customer requested and prioritize it.
          </h4>
          <p>
            Verifying the specific service that the customer requires is crucial
            to ensure that the appropriate service is provided and given
            priority during the appointment. Depending on how you phrase it,
            this could also be an opportunity for us to make our customer aware
            of the availability of the other services we offer.
          </p>
          <p>Here is an example script to verify the service that the user is requesting for:

</p>
<em><ul>
    <li>Just to make sure, we're coming for the roof, right? That's the priority? Or was it the roof and the windows?

</li>

</ul></em>
<p>In this script, even though we already know that the customer is requesting for the service on their roof, we mention the windows to effectively prompt the customer about other available services, which can be an opportunity for upselling.
</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>
            Inquire about the utility bill and confirm that it is over $85 per
            month.
          </h4>
          <p>Keep this simple. A one-liner like below should do the trick:</p>
          <em>
<ul>
    <li>What are you guys paying every two months?</li>
</ul>
        </li></em>

        <li>
          <h4>
            Ask if there are any existing liens, bankruptcies, or forbearances
            on the property.
          </h4>
          <p>
            The timing is vital for this question. Ask this immediately after
            getting the number for the utility bill question.
          </p>
<em><ul>
    <li>Any liens, bankruptcies, or forbearances there?
        <ul>
            <li>
              If there is a bankruptcy, inquire about when it happened and which
              chapter was filed. Was it Chapter 7 or Chapter 11?
            </li>
            <li>
              If there is a lien, inquire about the details, including who
              placed the lien and the reason for it.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the customer has a lien, inform them that they might not
              qualify for two of the three programs, and a sales representative
              will check for other available options.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there is a forbearance, inquire about the details, including
              when it happened and if the customer has the letter.
            </li>
          </ul>
    </li>
</ul></em>

          
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Note:</h4>
      <p>
        The order of the questions is not all that important. The important
        thing is to ask them all because that will ensure that the job is done
        on the scheduled date with no delays due to the decision-makers not
        being available. This also ensures that we are able to determine the
        appropriate financial plan for the customer.
