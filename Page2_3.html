      <h3>H Drive Read and Write Access</h3>

      <p>
        A. Read Access – This is by default provided to users with H drive
        provisioning.
      </p>
      <p>
        B. Write Access – After the OneDrive migration, write access is no
        longer default for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the default setup, Home Drive has limited access permissions,
        specifically Read Only (R/O). It is not possible to store any data on
        Home Drive (H:), except for the folders that have been approved for
        Application data, which include System and Explorer/Favorites. These
        approved folders grant Read and Write (R/W) access.
      </p>
