      <h2>Lost or Stolen Process for PC</h2>
      <h3>Step 1: Security incident ticket creation</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Document the relevant details of theft or loss incident including the
          user's contact number.
        </li>
        <li>
          Report the incident to the Security Team following the instructions in
          <a href="#" target="_blank">
            KBA0000 Security - What can be a security incident and how to report
            it to the Security Operations Center.</a
          >
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note: Even when any information required by the Security Team couldn't
        be obtained from the user, it is essential that the incident is reported
        to them immediately. Any missing information will be provided by the
        local Service Desk as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 2: Information to the user</h3>
      <p>Global service desk will inform the user of the following:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          For security reasons, the AD password/XYZ Authentication code will be
          reset, making it impossible to access the Company ABC environment.
          Additionally, the 123 key will be revoked if the user has one.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Local Service Desk will contact the user during business hours
          (8:30 EST) to gather more information and draft a "Stolen/Lost Report"
          for internal reporting. This report will be sent to the user and their
          line manager for completion.
        </li>
        <li>
          The user must report the incident to the police and obtain a copy of
          the "theft report" or "lost property report."
        </li>
        <li>
          The user should submit the completed "Stolen/Lost Report" and the copy
          of the police report to the local Service Desk as soon as possible.
          The new device request process can only be started once the
          "Stolen/Lost Report" is submitted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if the device is found, the "Stolen/Lost Report" must still be
          submitted, and the device must be returned to IT for security
          inspection. A new IT device request is necessary in this case as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The same information as above will be sent to the user's line manager
          by email.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Step 3: Email communication to the user and user's line manager</h3>
      <p>
        Global service desk agent also emails the same information as above to
        the user and user's line manager by using email template in the
        following
        <a href="#" target="_blank">link</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: XYZ/eToken Revocation</h3>
      <p>Global service desk agent revokes XYZ/eToken using XYZ admin tool.</p>

      <h3>Step 5: EFG Key Revocation</h3>
      <p>
        Global service desk agent raises a EFG Key revoke request to EFG Support
        team by e-mail.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Step 6: Creation of another incident and hand-over to local Service Desk
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          GlobalService Desk will create another incident ticket documenting the
          following:
          <ul>
            <li>
              All the relevant information about the theft or loss provided by
              the user:
            </li>
            <li>User's contact number:</li>
            <li>Actions taken:</li>
            <li>Security ticket number:</li>
            <li>Was the user provided the information indicated in Step 2?</li>
            <li>
              Was the email communication sent to the user and user's line
              manager?
            </li>
            <li>Was the XYZ/eToken revocation completed?</li>
            <li>
              Was the email sent to EFG Support team team to request revocation
              of EFG team key?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Global Service Desk will send an e-mail to local Service Desk to
          inform the ticket assignment and the incident ticket number.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local Service Desk will take over the Incident ticket and will
          complete the remaining process.
        </li>
      </ol>
